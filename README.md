# YouTubeURLGetter
## _Helping YouTube content creators from YouTube's antics_

Retrieve all of a YouTube content creator's videos' title + url and save to a .csv file. 
Purpose: YouTube is deleting old videos that break new guidelines and asking for a URL for a deleted video if they want it reviewed. This will create a micro .csv database to capture a user's video title and its url to help with this problem.

## Installation
Install the dependencies.
```sh
pip install pandas
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv <your-env>
<your-env>\Scripts\activate
<your-env>\Scripts\pip.exe install google-api-python-client
```

## Running
In the creds.py file, set values for 
```
api_key => Your api key
channel_id => YouTube user's unique channel id. Can be found by sending a GET request from the channel and looking at the META tags. CTRL+F 'channelid'
OUTPUT_FILE =>  What you want your output file to be called
```

Run command: ``` python .\YouTubeURLGetter\YouTubeURLGrabber.py ```
